MVP:
- As a user, I want to play a challenging memory game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how my final score matches up to others with a high score page.
- As a user, I want the game page to be colorful and engaging.
- As a developer, I want to be able to display the high scores after the game has been lost.
- As a developer, I want take the user's name as input and display it on the game page and on the high score page.
- As a developer, I want the game to be colorful and engaging so that users will come back and play again.
- As a developer, I want to use a loop to keep adding random values to an array to generate the colors that are being flashed.

Stretch goals:
- As a user, I would like multiple rounds that get increasingly harder so I can be mentally challenged.
- As a developer, I would like to use multiple CSS transition/translation types to keep the user engaged and confused.
